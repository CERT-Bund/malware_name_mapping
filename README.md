Malware Name Mapping
====================

There are a lot of different malware names used in the IT security community for the same kind of malware.
This repository holds regular expression to match those and derive a commonly used malware *family* name.

This mapping is used in reporting (as generic name) and for statistics purpose.

Format
------

Currently it is comma-separated. The meaning of the columns is:

 1. regular expression, starting with `^` and ending with `$`. It can/should be applied case-insensitive. The field is encapsulated in double quotes (`"`).
 2. malware family name
 3. optional comment, starting with `# `

Tests
-----

To check the validity of the file, you can run `./test.sh`. It shows all lines not matching the format.
